Open_maple welcomes contributors!
If you want to contribute, TODO.txt lists (in order) features that are
    going to be implemented next.
If you want to implement a different feature, please file an issue on github,
    and the maintainers of this project will get in touch.

Rules for contributing:
    All code must be run through golint, and all tests must pass,
        before code is added to the repository.

    Tests must be written for each functional unit of the code,
        and must attempt to cover any edge cases.
        For example, the tokenizer, parser, and interpreter
        must all have seperate tests. Despite this, it is encouraged
        to write more tests, preferably one per function.

    It is encouraged, but not required, to write tests for non-production
        code stored in debug_util.go

    Each function that is intended to be called outside of its own source file
        must be at the top of a source file, and seperated via a comment banner.
            (Refer to any non-test, non-utility source file for an example)
    Exceptions to this rule are any functions within debug_util.go and util.go,
        which are all intended to be called outside of its own source file.

Documentation:
    Each source file, enum group, and function must have a comment above it.
    Source file: Purpose of file, intended file interface.
    Enum group: Purpose of enum group
    Function: Description of function, inputs, and outputs.

    If a term is defined in a source file or design document,
        it does not need to be redefined in function documentation.
