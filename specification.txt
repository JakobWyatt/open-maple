This specification outlines the features currently supported in the open_maple language.
This specification can be considered a 'language standard' for the purposes of this project.

This current version of open_maple can be considered a "procedural" programming language,
    consisting of multiple statements that are evaluated in order.

These statements are seperated by semicolons [;]
Within a statement, variables can be assigned values via the syntax
    [name] := [expression]

Names must not contain the following characters
    [; : = * / + -]
Or begin with the following characters
    [; : = * / + - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 .]

Any valid mathematical expression containing variables, operators, and numbers is an [expression]
Operators currently supported in open_maple are
    Multiplication [*] | Division [/]
    Addition [+] | Subtraction [-]

Code Examples:
    Assignment:
        x1 := 6*5 /4/3;
        y2 := arg01+ -14 * arg01;
