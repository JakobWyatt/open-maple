This specification outlines the features currently supported in the open_maple language.
This specification can be considered a 'language standard' for the purposes of this project.

Mathematical operators:
    Mathematical operators currently supported in open_maple are:
        Multiplication (*)
        Division (/)
        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)

Assignment:
    Variables can be assigned in open_maple by using the syntax
    [variable-name] := [mathematical expression]

The following list shows the precedance of these operators,
    with operators at the beginning of the list being evaluated first.
    When operators have the same precedence, the expression is evaluated left-to-right.
        Multiplication | Division
        Addition | Subtraction
        Assignment

Whitespace is not considered between operators.
Variable names are case sensitive.
Statements are seperated by semicolons ";"
